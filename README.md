 This is a 2D sidescrolling platformer game reminicant to games such as the Mario series, Kirby and so on. It's my first more complete version of a game really, and I really enjoyed the whole process of creating it! Even the annoying yet simple errors I made along the way :smile:


 So far I've loaded up and interacted with the Tile Selector and created a Rule Tile to actually paint my landscape automatically based on its nearby tiles, which has been fun but also a bit clunky at first till I got the hang of it.

 First time working with the animation/er within Unity, which has been quite interesting and eye-opening.

 Using the InputSystem package for the players input setup has been a lovely discovery I must say.
